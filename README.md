# Cypress Automation Learning ðŸš€
This repository contains my **learning journey in Cypress** â€“ a modern JavaScript-based automation testing framework.  
I am practicing concepts step by step from a comprehensive Udemy course, and documenting my progress here.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Build strong foundation in Cypress and JavaScript basics
- Practice UI automation for real-world web applications
- Learn API testing and integrate it with E2E tests
- Apply Page Object design pattern for maintainable tests
- Explore advanced topics like reporting, Docker, and CI/CD

## ðŸ“š Learning Path (from Udemy course)

### Foundation Skills
- JavaScript fundamentals for beginners
- Locator strategies for any web element
- Element identification and interaction

### Core Cypress Capabilities
- Cypress architecture and command flow
- Writing test cases with assertions
- Browser automation with Cypress runner

### API Testing Integration
- API basics and fundamentals
- Mocking API responses
- Combining API + UI for E2E scenarios

### Code Organization & Maintainability
- Page Object design pattern
- Reusable functions and fixtures
- Scalable test suite structure

### Advanced Topics
- Environment variables
- Multiple reporters and retry logic
- Dockerized Cypress execution
- Parallel testing & Cypress Dashboard
- Cross-browser & Visual testing
